PHP-SMPTE-functions
===================

Some functions to deal with SMPTE code

Goal:

1) Turn formatted SMPTE code into an array of hours, minutes, seconds and frames

2) Sum the array up into frames, so that it's more easy to add and subtract from other sets of SMPTE frames

3) Sum the frames back up into an array

4) Turn the array into a formatted SMPTE code again
